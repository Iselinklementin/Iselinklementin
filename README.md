### Hi there 👋

I’m a graphic designer and soon to be Front-End Developer.
I’m a fast learner and have a strong desire to use my new skills in frontend web development. 
I’d love to work with forward-thinking people to design and build interactive, accessible websites.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning react & next.js
- 👩‍🎨 I previously worked as a designer
- ⚡ I like learning, structure, laughter, pretty colors & gaming
