### Hi there 👋

I´m a graphic designer and soon to be Front-End Developer. 
I graduate from Noroff in the spring of 2022.
I am a fast learner and have a strong desire to use my new skills in frontend web development.
UX, beautiful pixels and writing clean accessible code matters to me.

🌱 I’m currently learning react & next.js

👩‍🎨 I previously worked as a designer

⚡ I like laughter, learning, structure, pretty colors, honesty & gaming
